        About Us
    </h2>
    <p6>
        At Booston Dynamiks robotics team, we strive to make robotics and engineering more easily understood and accessible to students. We teach students how to code, program, design, build, and test robots and other more simple and basic things like how to solder, basic electrical and mechanical engineering, and more. We don't just do robotics however, we also host a bunch of cool events where people including younger students can come, share and learn about new ideas.
